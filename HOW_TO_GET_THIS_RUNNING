Creating WAR file
- Note that the maven builds can be run from within eclipse as well
- Run the following local folder scripts (mvn must be installed on machine):
  - build.command
  - deploy.command


The Jetty server serving the client application can be run by running the "launch" script in the folder below:
/Users/sawant/development/jetty-distribution-9.1.3.v20140225


OLD-COMMENT: Start the agent only after server is running. Note that the config URL (see below) must be hit first and fast so that the agent catches the udpated config before the test code runs through

URLs to hit:
- http://localhost:8080/escala/create_log_config.html
  - Values to fill: com.acme.HelloWorld    /   doGet
  - Values to fill: AgentTestTargetClass   /   fooLong

- http://localhost:8080/test/hello/
- http://localhost:8080/escala/apis/logentries
